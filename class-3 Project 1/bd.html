                        It's a small piece of silver with five symbols on one side. It originates in Magadha. Magadha is
                        one of the 16
                        Mahajanpadas or Great Kingdoms, mentioned in the religious book of the Buddhists, Anguttara
                        Nikaya. It is thought that
                        this kingdom covers Patna in Bihar, Gaya up till Bengal. Several dynasties ruled this area from
                        545 BC to 600 AD. Most
                        historians and archeologists claim that among the coins of specific empires, the Magdha coins
                        are the most ancient coins
                        that have been found in Bengal.

                    <p>
                        The book, 'Understanding the Coins of Bengal, Ancient to Early Modern Period', has details on
                        172 types of symbols used
                        on the coins discovered in this region. In this book authored by Md Shariful Islam and Md
                        Mosharraf Hossain, it is said
                        that these coins were etched with images of the sun, six-spoke wheel, flora and fauna and
                        sometimes even human images.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Inscribed coins of around the same period or even older have been found in at least three places
                        of the Bengal region --
                        Chandraketugarh of West Bengal, Wari-Bateshwar in Dhaka's northeast, and Bogura's Mahasthangarh.
                        These coins have
                        resemblance to the coins issued by the Magadha's Maurya royal dynasty, but were independent.
                        These had four symbols
                        instead of five. The emblems used repeatedly were wheels, oxen, birds, ploughs, boats,
                        elephants, fish, prawns, the sun
                        at different stages of the day and so on.

                    <p>
                        Historians have identified all kings from the first ruler king of the Magadha kingdom,
                        Brihadratha, to all the pre- and
                        post-Maurya dynasty rulers. In his book Arthashastra, Chandra Gupta Maurya's minister Kautilya
                        explained how the coins
                        of that era were made. But who were in charge of those three regions of Bengal? What did they
                        look like? Did they have
                        long hair? Were they big made? Dark-skinned or fair? And how were the people of the region? What
                        did they eat? How were
                        their lifestyles? Their wealth?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is no way to get answers to these questions directly because Bangladesh has no initiative
                        to decipher the
                        inscriptions on the coins that speak about the history of specific times. However, in this day
                        and age, deciphering coin
                        inscriptions has become easier than ever before.

                    <p>
                        The biggest collection of coins from the different eras of Bengal is at the Bangladesh National
                        Museum. Of the 96,000
                        artifacts in the museum, 56,000 are coins. There is no clear information on how many coin
                        inscriptions couldn't be
                        deciphered as yet. Managing director of the National Museum, Md Kamruzzaman, said, "Over 50 per
                        cent of the coins
                        haven't been deciphered as yet."

                    <p>
                        Monirul Huq, the official in charge of the coins and keeper of the history and classical art
                        department, said, "This
                        cannot be specified accurately. There are a few hundred copies of each coin. The inscriptions of
                        probably around 5000
                        types of coins have not been deciphered." Another source said that the museum authorities have
                        made three catalogues of
                        the deciphered coins. These catalogues have details on the coins and gold coins of ancient
                        Bengal. Outside of this, it
                        has not been possible to decipher other coins and there is hardly any initiative in this
                        regard."
